    <h1 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: center; font-size: 50px;"> My Strongest Trait and Emotion</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
      My strongest trait is my ability to be strongly goal-oriented and organized. This allows me to set specific goals for each stage in my academic journey. For example, when I just came to UTECH, in my first year, I aimed to achieve a 4.0 GPA by the end of that year. Although I did not attain the full 4.0, I obtained a 3.92 which to the best of my memory is the highest I've ever attained in my entire academic journey. This accomplishment motivates me to work even harder to achieve bigger things and accomplish academic and career goals I never previously imagined possible for myself. <br><br>
      Similarly, I set a personal goal to learn the programming languages to create websites in my first year. Consequently, this summer I embarked on learning HTML, CSS and Javascript so that I could start my web development journey. In doing so, I gained the basic skills on how to create websites and luckily, this semester, the hard work that I committed to in the summer is paying off as I already have substantial knowledge on areas of this course (Web programming). Subsequently, I have saved tremendous time and mental effort trying to learn these languages now in contrast to other students who are learning them for the first time. <br><br>
      In addition to my goal-oriented mindset, gratitude plays a significant role in shaping my academic experience. Having been on the receiving end of various forms of assistance through scholarships to fund my University education, I feel a deep sense of gratitude that drives me to make the very best efforts to be successful. This gratitude pushes me to take full advantage of the opportunities I've been given, knowing that education is not something everyone can easily access. It fosters a positive mindset that encourages me to be resilient during difficult times and reminds me to stay grounded as I appreciate the support systems that have helped me along the way.<br> <br>	\
      There is also the fact that I play multiple instruments as an hobby so that may account for some of my academic success. There are studies that show that learning to play an instrument is linked to improved memory skills. According to (Tozzoli, 2021), this improvement is attributed to the complex cognitive processes involved in music education, which stimulate brain development and enhance neural connections.

    <h1 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: center; font-size: 50px;"> My Hero</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
      My hero is my father and one of his personal mottos is " Your mind is like soil; what you plant is what you will get". Notably, Just as a garden thrives when carefully tended, so too does the mind flourish when filled with positive thoughts and meaningful actions. This is a profound motto that has helped to change certain mindsets that I had before and has allowed me to adapt new ways of thinking that has changed how I perceive life. <br><br>
      My father is my hero, not just because of what he has achieved, but because of who he is. He did not come from much. Growing up in a poverty-stricken home, he worked his way up to become a skilled worker and a Pastor, creating opportunities for himself and our family through hard work and perseverance. His story of resilience and determination serves as a constant reminder to me that no matter where you start in life, what you plant in your mind and nurture with effort and discipline will eventually bear fruit.<br><br>
      He is more than just a provider; he's also a leader, a father, a husband, and a man of God. His faith guides him, and it is through that faith that he has taught me important life lessonsâ€”patience, kindness, and integrity. He leads by example, never asking of others what he isn't willing to do himself, whether in his work or in his relationships. I look up to him because he has shown me what it means to be strong, not just physically but emotionally and spiritually as well.<br><br>
      As a role model, he has set a high standard for the kind of person I aspire to be: someone who leads with integrity, gives generously, and stands firm in their faith and values. His commitment to our family and his ability to balance the many roles he plays is something I deeply admire. He's always there to offer advice, to help me make sense of the challenges life throws my way, and his wisdom has undoubtedly shaped the person I am today.<br><br>
      Ultimately, my father's motto about the mind being like soil isn't just about thinking positively; it's about being intentional in every area of life. It's about choosing what to focus on, where to invest time, energy, and faith, knowing that the fruits of those efforts will one day blossom into success. His life is living proof of this philosophy, and as I continue to grow, I strive to live by these principles. <br><br>

      In general, the test is valid often capture broad traits that people can identify with. However, its broad categorizations may not fully encompass the complexities of a person's character or life experiences. <br><br>
      In my individual case, I find the result describing me as "realistic" to be somewhat valid. I do value practicality and prefer dealing with concrete facts and experiences rather than abstract ideas. I often approach situations in a hands-on, logical manner, which aligns with the test's description. However, while this trait fits a large part of my personality, it doesn't capture my full range of qualities, such as my creativity or emotional depth, which are equally significant in how I navigate life.
